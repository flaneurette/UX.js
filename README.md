UX.js is a powerful and lightweight JavaScript framework designed for building both single-page applications (SPAs) and multi-page applications (MPAs) with ease. It provides a structured and efficient approach to frontend development, enabling developers to create dynamic, interactive, and highly responsive web applications.

Key Features of UX.js

- Reactive Modules – UX.js leverages a reactive programming model, allowing components and data to update automatically when changes occur, eliminating the need for manual DOM manipulation.
- UX Components – The framework introduces a component-based architecture, enabling developers to build reusable, modular UI elements for scalable application development.
- UX Plugin Support – Extend the core functionality of UX.js with plugins, allowing seamless integration of additional features, third-party libraries, and custom enhancements.
- UX Events & Methods – A robust event-handling system provides a clean way to manage user interactions and application logic through defined methods and event-driven programming.
- Automates the most common front-end development tasks 

With its focus on simplicity, flexibility, and performance, UX.js is an excellent choice for developers looking to build modern web applications with a clean and maintainable codebase.

# What is new
### UX.js Version 1.8: Exciting New Features & Enhancements
The release of UX.js v1.8 brings significant improvements, making the framework more powerful and flexible than ever. This version introduces:

- Reactive Models – A new reactivity system that ensures data updates are seamlessly reflected across the application without manual intervention. This enhancement simplifies state management and improves performance by efficiently handling UI updates.
- Plugin Support – Developers can now extend UX.js with plugins, enabling easy integration of additional features, third-party tools, and custom functionalities. This opens the door for a more modular and scalable development experience.

### UX.js Version 1.4: introduces Components. 

Components are reusable HTML fragments with a .ux extension. UX.js renders these components within a HTML page asynchronously, with the :render or :route attribute. For a demo, see UX-render.html in the examples folder.
