UX.js is a frontend development JavaScript library and framework.

# What is new
Version 1.4 introduces components. Components are reusable HTML fragments with a .ux extension. UX.js renders these components within a HTML page, asynchronously, with the :render or :route attribute. Components can have data placeholders to be parsed by UX.js. In this way, a website can be completely build from reusable components, making it easy to reuse components across a website or other websites. For a demo, see UX-render.html in the examples folder.
